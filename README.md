Course Description
----

This course provides the necessary mathematical, conceptual and technological foundations to practically apply modern neural networks (colloquially called "Deep Learning") to everyday machine learning problems. Although topics are presented in an accessible way, the course is angled towards professionals with a reasonable background in programming and some mathematics background as well. 

The class will focus on practical development of fundamental skills, and is intended as a point of departure for professionals interested in moving into machine learning applications germane to many modern embedded technologies such as drones, intelligent systems (e.g. smart homes) and self-driving cars. This area is exciting due to the many possibilities it affords and the relatively low barriers to entry.

Dependent on class performance, we may cover advanced topics such as Neural Turing Machines and Deep-Q networks in the last week.


### By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Apply Deep Learning to solve real world problems
- Explain and implement backpropagation algorithm
- Build and optimize the following architectures:
    - Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - Autoencoders
    - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Have the resources and experience to be able to progress on your own


### Out of Scope

- All other kinds of machine learning (We are only covering Deep Learning)
- All other Deep Learning frameworks (We are only covering Keras and TensorFlow)
   - Theano, Caffe, CNTK, DSSTNE, PaddlePaddle, â€¦
   - OpenAI Gym/Universe & DeepMind Lab
   - High Performance Computing (HPC)
   - Distributed systems
- ALL other hardware implementations (We are only covering CPU and GPUs)
    - ASIC
    - Mobile

### Prerequisites

The student should have the equivalent of 2 years programming experience in Python and basic background in mathematics through 3 semesters of calculus. Strength in vector mathematics will help significantly as will ability to think visually. 

### Required Resources 

#### Books
- _Fundamentals of Deep Learning_
- [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

Class Structure
----

This course is an "active" learning environment. You'll learn through doing. The focus will be on explaining concepts in your words and applying concepts through programming.

Before class you will complete preparation materials. All preparation materials should be covered __prior__ to the start of each class session. They are __always required__ unless explicitly labeled as optional. These materials will be the source of factual knowledge. You are expected to be familiar with the basic concepts and technical jargon before the start of class.

In-class time is precious - We'll reserve it for discussion, presenting complex material, answering questions, and working on exercises.  

Typical class structure:

1. Class Review / discussion of OYO activity
1. Lecture
1. Lab

### Complete On Your Own (OYO) activity

OYO activity is a creative activity to help you to integrate and apply the the preparation materials. These are to be completed before class begins. 

### Labs

Students will separate into two (or threes) for "pair programming". These exercises may involve a series of short questions, single day projects, or multi-day projects.

### Mastery Tracking

We will be using Galvanize's Learning Management System (LMS) which can be found at [learn.galvanize.com](https://learn.galvanize.com).

### Participation

You must also show up prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random, not to put you on the spot but, to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

Attendance is __mandatory__. You cannot get the benefit of the material simply by reading it. It is the responsibility of each student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to any circumstances, please notify Jared by email ASAP.
